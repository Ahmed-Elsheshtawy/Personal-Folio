# Personal CV Website

Just a simple online CV/resume I made to showcase my education, skills, and projects. Nothing fancy, just HTML and CSS.

## What's in here?

- My contact info and socials
- Education background
- Skills I've picked up
- Projects I've worked on
- Languages I speak

## How to use

Just open `index.html` in your browser and you're good to go. That's it.

Made this while learning web development, so it's pretty straightforward.
